I've been here on three different occasions now (friends, date, and pick-up), and it has been great each and every time.

Note 1:  There are two locations in SF-- in the Mission and in WestAdd (on Divisadero).  Divisadero location is a bit smaller but you'll have a better chance of getting seats quickly here.
Note 2:  No reservations by phone.  It's a show-and-wait, so plan on signing your name, get a quick tour of the block (or go get 1 drink, no more than that) and you'll be fine.  The list moves up much faster than you'd think.

I'd strongly recommend the Little Star-- whether or not you're vegetarian.  Another dish I really like is the Classic.  I always get the Deep Dish, so can't say much about the thin crust pizzas, but the Deep Dish are just superb-- and this is combining my experience of searching for some of the best deep dish pizzas in Chicago and NYC!!

You should consider getting 1 Large pizza for every 2.5 adults.

Ok went here with a friend recently. After hearing all the ranting and raving reviews from all my friends and coworker, I have to say I was overall disappointed. We ended up getting the plain deep dish pizza and some chicken wings. Ok the wings were pretty good. They were black pepper galore :) I loved it. Medium sized wings with pretty juicy too. Nothing covered in oil or anything like that.

The pizza on the other hand was just so so. I have only been to a couple other places that specialize in deep dish pizza. The crust was flavorless and a little too hard. The sauce not so good imo. More like I was eating bread with some sauce on it and some cheese. I think the trendiness might have just run away with this place.
